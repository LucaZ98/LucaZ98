### Hi there 👋

I'm Luca Zerman and I'm a Mathematical Engineering master student at Politecnico di Milano. My master studies are focused on Machine Learning and Data Science, in addition to Reinforcement Learning and Time Series analysis. I have to thank statistical and probabilistical courses from Bachelor's for this because they allowed me to discover this beautiful field that was unknown to me.
